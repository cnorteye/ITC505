        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            The process of creating the Lights Out game involved several phases, each contributing to a final, interactive game that is both functional and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
           For the <strong class="rubik-maze-regular" >HTML Structure</strong>, I created a basic structure with a <code class="rubik-pixels-regular">div</code> for the game board and sections for move count and timer. 
           In the <strong class="rubik-maze-regular">CSS Styling</strong>, I used grid layout for the game board to arrange the squares effectively. 
           For the <strong class="rubik-maze-regular">JavaScript Functionality</strong>, I implemented a game logic including square toggling, move counting and timer functionality. 
           I also added the ability to reset the game.
        </p>
        <p>
           I made a few <strong class="rubik-maze-regular">creative choices</strong> that I believe enhanced the website. 
           I <em class="rubik-pixels-regular">chose bright colors</em> for the game squares to make the toggling effect visually appealing. 
           For example, I choose the default yellow color because it stands out against the game’s background.
           I also <em class="rubik-pixels-regular">integrated a timer and move counter</em> to enhance the competitive aspect of the game. 
           The timer adds a sense of urgency, while the move counter helps players track their efficiency.
           To add an interesting element to the Lights Out game page, I used a customer Google fonts for the <strong class="rubik-maze-regular">Font Serving</strong> feature.  
           I included the Google Fonts stylesheet link the the HTML  <code class="rubik-pixels-regular">head</code> section. 
           In the CSS file, I applied the custom font <em class="rubik-pixels-regular">'MooLahLah-Regular'</em> font family to the body of the page. 
           I also added the <em class="rubik-pixels-regular">'rubik-pixels-regular'</em> and <em class="rubik-pixels-regular">'rubik-maze-regular'</em> to the paragraph tags in the addendum to add some visual marks in the text.

        </p>
        <p>
            Like with any website design, there were some <strong class="rubik-maze-regular">challenges</strong> that came up along the way.
            One of the challenges I faced was <em class="rubik-pixels-regular">ensuring that the game state resets correctly upon refresh or using the reset button.</em> 
            I overcame that by implementing a resetBoard function that clears the board and resets the timer and move count. 
            Another issue I encounted was <em class="rubik-pixels-regular" >synchronizing the timer with the game’s start and reset functionality.</em> 
            I was able to resolve that by creating functions to start and update the timer, ensuring that it starts with the game and stops when the game is won. 
            I also added an alert to the user once the game is won. Lastly, I managed the timer state using JavaScript intervals and handled resetting the timer appropriately.
            Last, but not the least, there was a challenge with <em class="rubik-pixels-regular" >ensuring that user input (clicking on squares) is correctly processed and that adjacent squares are toggled as expected.</em> 
            My solution for that was to implemented logic to toggle squares and their adjacent ones, with checks for boundaries to prevent errors. I used event listeners effectively to handle user interactions.

        </p>
        <p>
           One of my <strong class="rubik-maze-regular">takeaways</strong> from creating this game is to that regular testing is essential for refining game mechanics and interface design. 
           Iterative development allows for the identification and resolution of issues early in the process.
           Additionally, it is also important to balance visual appeal with functionality which will add to enhancing the overall user experience. 
           For example, choosing appropriate colors, providing clear instructions, and ensuring smooth interactions contribute to a more enjoyable game.
